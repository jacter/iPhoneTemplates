These are just some Xcode templates I made for making iPhone apps setup with Google Toolbox for Mac.  To install them run the bash script in the Project Templates directory, as sudo, i.e. sudo ./install\_template.   This will create new project and file templates in Xcode which setup identical projects to those already provided by Apple, but with Google Toolbox for Mac setup for Unit Testing.  When creating a new Project choose the Google Toolbox category, then the View-based Application or OpenGL ES Application.  For a new Unit Test file choose the Google Toolbox category and the Google Toolbox Test Case.  This will set you up with a Unit Test that contains a failing test.  Make sure you put all your unit tests in the Unit Test bundle, and all your other classes in both bundles so the test files can see the class files you're testing.  The build is already setup so that if your Unit Tests fail your Application will fail to build as well.

That's all there is to it.
